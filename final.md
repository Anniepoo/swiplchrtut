Conclusion
-----------

CHR is a powerful addition to the logic programmer's toolkit. I hope you'll find it useful.

I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial. If you notice any mistakes, or want to suggest improvements, or just are totally stumped, email annie (at) swi-prolog (dot) org and let me know.

You can often find me as Anniepoo on ##prolog channel on freenode.net IRC.

Thanks to Thom Fruewirth for the CHR library and for answering questions on the CHR list and email. 
Thanks to Alan Baljeu for much patient coaching on the CHR list and for spending a while on video call explaining CHR.
Thanks to Falco Nogatz for yet more explanations, and for the CHR single threaded server.
Thanks to Tom Schrijvers, whose slides from ICLP are a great resource. I've also stolen a few examples in this tutorial from his work. Thanks to Michael Richter, who puzzled out bits of this with me and in particular how the right hand side works. Thanks to Gerg√∂ Barany for a pleasant afternoon in Vienna spent puzzling out bits of CHR.
